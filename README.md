## Overview
### Description
Connects families that are in need with groceries and toiletries with assistance from donors. The application allows families to add items to their cart. Donors can use the application to help make a positive impact on families through donations. The app organization will handle the shopping and delivery.
### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Food & Drink
- **Mobile:** This app would primarily be developed for moved but there will be a version for the desktop. The features would be the same for both versions; however, there will be different user interfaces.
- **Story:** Displays current selection of groceries and toiletries and uploads their request to the database where donors can potentially help the family.
- **Market:** The application allows users to sign up as a Donor or a Family. A user can have both accounts and are not limited to either. They must make separate accounts if they would like to switch views.
- **Habit:** This app can be used as often as a family desires or a donor desires. The app usage depends on the need to update item lists or the desire to help families out
- **Scope:** First we will start with in person deliveries by the organization that wants to help the families in need. Once there is growth and the usage broadens, we hope that more donors can help and pay for the costs of groceries and delivery.
